Cornell Tech Internship Data Analysis - Sample Code.
1.	The experiment lasted for 6 weeks. 
2.	As part of the experiment, we gathered participants through Amazon's Turk Prime platform and monitored their Facebook activity using a research platform BeeHive. 
3.	This platform was developed by Cornell Tech SmallData lab in order to help researchers to conduct various productivity experiments. 
4.	During the experiment we asked participants to install an application on their Android cell phones and throughout the six weeks, depending on the previously, randomly assigned groups (control - 0, static - 1, dynamic - 2), the participants received vibrations to their devices. The vibrations arrived after using Facebook app for a certain amount of time (in minutes). 
5.	The goal was to observe whether the vibrations can reduce participantâ€™s Facebook usage time.
6.	In my exploratory analysis of this data I performed data cleaning and visualization in an attempt to uncover patterns of the effects of the vibrations in this initial part of the study.
